# gesfusion
Config files for my GitHub profile.

The shells listed below help install rpmfusion automatically.
This is separate to apply to Fedora Linux / REHEL-Rocky Linux

- Fedora - fedorafusion

$ git clone https://github.com/simmon-nplob/gesfusion.git
# cd gesfusion
# chmod u+x fedorafusion
# ./fedorafusion

- Rocky/Rehel - gelfusion

$ git clone https://github.com/simmon-nplob/gesfusion.git
# cd gesfusion
# chmod u+x gelfusion
# ./gelfusion

Even if the version information is different, it will automatically find and install it.
Have a fun! so, easy!
